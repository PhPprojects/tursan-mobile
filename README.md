# Tursan Mobile Application 1.0

This is the first version of an Ionic based application that I did as a freelancer. I'm open sourcing it because for the version 2.0 I didn't receive any payment from the company. You can freely distribute the application in any way you want.

### Installation

Using npm `npm i` or with yarn `yarn`.

Also install cordova and ionic using `npm i -g cordova` and `npm i -g ionic-cli`

### Running on iOS

```javascript
  ionic run ios
```

### Running on Android

```javascript
  ionic run android
```
